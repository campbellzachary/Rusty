Rez
=============================
Indie Game - 2D Platform game
=============================

Rez is our fictional hero in this new indie-platform video game. He is a small, furry, Asian red panda who resides in a temperate forest on the foothills of the Himalayas. The player must take the role of our fuzzy protagonist who must fight off snow leopards, martins and his greatest foe, mankind! Not all is what it seems for our furry friend, as things are about to change in Langtang Forest... and only our hero can save the day! Rez will have to face major threats such as deforestation, hunters, and animal trade!

Rez will be created with the help of ForeignGuyMike's web tutorial on how to make a platform game.
